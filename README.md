# Description
"Guess the Number" is a simple Python-based game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess that number. The game provides feedback after each guess, informing the player whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, and then it displays the number of attempts it took to win.

# How It Works
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The player is prompted to guess the number. After each guess, the player receives feedback: "Too low!" if the guess is lower than the number. "Too high!" if the guess is higher than the number. "Congratulations!" if the guess is correct. The game keeps track of the number of attempts. Once the player guesses the correct number, the game ends and displays the total number of attempts.
